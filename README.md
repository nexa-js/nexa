# 🚀 Nexa – The Future of API Orchestration for Frontend Development  

**Nexa** is a flexible, high-performance **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) framework** designed to simplify API integration and accelerate frontend development. With built-in support for **REST, GraphQL, data mocking, aggregation, and custom connectors**, Nexa helps frontend teams focus on UI/UX while keeping backend complexities under control.

## ✨ Features  
- **🛠️ Easy Data Mocking** – Quickly create mock APIs with **Faker.js** for seamless frontend testing.  
- **📡 Smart API Aggregation** – Fetch data from multiple backend sources and serve it as a single endpoint.  
- **📱 Customizable APIs** – Deliver tailored responses for web, mobile, and different frontend platforms.  
- **🔐 Built-in Security** – Secure API access with authentication, authorization, and role-based controls.  
- **⚡ Optimized Performance** – Reduce over-fetching and optimize API responses for faster frontends.  
- **🚀 Rapid Iteration** – Decouple frontend from backend changes and ship features faster.

## 📌 To-Do  
✅ **MVP Implementation** – Core BFF features, Express.js support, and API route handling.  
🔲 **GraphQL Support** – Add middleware for GraphQL queries and mutations.  
🔲 **Custom Middleware** – Authentication, RBAC, logging, and request transformations.  
🔲 **CLI Tooling** – Create a developer-friendly CLI for easy setup and configuration.  
🔲 **API Caching** – Improve performance by introducing request/response caching.  
🔲 **WebSockets** – Add real-time support for event-driven applications.  
🔲 **Plugins & Extensibility** – Allow custom connectors and middleware for deeper integrations.
