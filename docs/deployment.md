# Deployment & Production Setup

## Running Nexa in Production

Running Nexa in production requires some adjustments to ensure performance, reliability, and security. Here are the key steps to set up Nexa for production:

1. **Environment Variables:** Ensure sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and environment-specific configurations are stored in environment variables.
2. **Optimize Performance:** You may want to enable caching, compression, and other optimizations for production environments.
3. **Error Handling:** Set up proper error handling and logging to capture errors and monitor your app.
4. **Logging:** Use logging tools like Winston to capture logs and track requests and errors in production.

For example, to launch Nexa in production mode, you can configure `NEXA_DEV_MODE` and use production-specific settings:
```bash
NEXA_DEV_MODE=false
```

This ensures that Nexa is running in production mode, and you can adjust settings accordingly.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are critical for handling configuration settings that differ between development, staging, and production environments. These variables store sensitive data and configuration that shouldnâ€™t be hardcoded into your application.

To manage environment variables, create a `.env` file in your projectâ€™s root directory and add variables like:

```
DB_HOST=your-database-host
DB_USER=your-database-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
```

To access these variables in your code, use a package like `dotenv`:

```javascript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import { launchNexa } from '@nexa-js/nexa-core';

dotenv.config();

const dbHost = process.env.DB_HOST;

launchNexa((app) => {
    // ...
});
```

This ensures sensitive information is not exposed in the codebase and can be changed easily based on the environment.

## Security Best Practices

Security is critical in production environments. Here are some best practices for securing your Nexa app:

### 1. **Use HTTPS**

Ensure all your production traffic is encrypted by serving your app over HTTPS. You can set up HTTPS using a reverse proxy like Nginx or configure it directly with your Node.js server.

### 2. **Rate Limiting**

Use rate limiting to protect your app from denial-of-service attacks and to prevent abuse of your API. Packages like `express-rate-limit` can help implement this:

### 3. **Use a Strong JWT Secret**
When using JWT for authentication, ensure you have a strong and unique secret key. Store it securely in environment variables.

### 4. **Set HTTP Headers Securely**

Use `helmet` to set secure HTTP headers that protect your app from common web vulnerabilities:

### 5. **Data Encryption**

For any sensitive data that needs to be stored (like passwords or personal information), always encrypt it using a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt for passwords).

### 6. **Logging & Monitoring**

Set up proper monitoring tools to detect and respond to issues quickly.


## Summary

When deploying Nexa in production, make sure to:
- Set up **environment variables** for sensitive data and configurations.
- Ensure **security best practices**, like using HTTPS, sanitizing inputs, and implementing rate limiting.

These steps will help you ensure your Nexa app runs securely, efficiently, and reliably in a production environment.
