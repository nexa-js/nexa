# ðŸš€ Nexa â€“ The Future of API Orchestration for Frontend Development  

## Overview

Nexa is a cloud-native Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) framework designed to streamline frontend-backend communication. It enables rapid API development with built-in mocking, validation, and data aggregation.

## Key Features  
- Cloud-native: Easily deploy with Docker.
- Schema-based: Uses Zod for validation and auto-mocking.
- Automatic mocking: If a backend isn't implemented, Nexa will mock responses.
- File-based routing: Uses Next.js-style routes.
- Built-in pagination and filtering.
- Express middleware support.
